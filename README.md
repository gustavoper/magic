# Magic

The PHP Framework for Web Wizards who conjure *"Xablau!"*

## About

Magic is a web application framework for API development. Our project offers a simple and light-weight bootstrap skeleton
to build scalable aplications. We look for simplicity to understand its architecture and offer a door for begginners! 

## How to use it?

It architecture is base on MVC, but without the View layer. You just have to create a route, create a controller
and, if you want, create and use a Model. This is just the basics, you can craft, adapt and apply Design Patterns on Magic to kill your Dragons!
